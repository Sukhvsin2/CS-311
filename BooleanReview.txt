What is an Algebra?
  - Set of symbols and rules for manipulating those symbols

What is programming?
  - Some symbols and rules for manipulating those symbols

# function
F1(x,y,z) = x + y'z

F2(x,y) = xy + xy'

F3(x,y,z) = x'y'z + x'yz + xy' => x'z + xy'

F5(x,y) = (x + y)' (x' + y')'
        = (x'y') (xy) Demorgan's law
        = 0 NULL

POS - Product of Sums
F2(a,b,c) = (a+b) (a+c)

SOP - Sum of Products
F1(x,y,z) = X + xy + y'z
